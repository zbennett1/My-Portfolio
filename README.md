### Projects

#### Excel Grade Calculator
- ![Grade Calculator](https://github.com/zbennett1/My-Portfolio/blob/main/CS105%20excel%20project%20picture.png?raw=true)
- Initial project idea: 
I came up with this project because I knew that I could use an excel graph to help solve the problem of knowing your final grade for a class because it is sometimes hard to calculate 
I used multiple microsoft excel features. The first being the sum function which I used to multiply each different grade by their percentage of weight and add them all together to get the final grade. I also used conditional formatting to tell me weather the final grade I got was high enough for my liking, which for me is a 90+
I had trouble at first coming up with the formula I wa going to use to calculate the final grade but I used previous knowledge of grade calculation to help me overcome that. I also had trouble doing conditional formatting for a singular cell as at first it tries to highlight all cells.
I did not use any other resources except a calculator to check my work
I set out to achieve a grade calculator based on percentage weight and I believe I achieved that. In the future I would like to add a calculator for all classes and calculate gpa
Overall this was a fun project that helped me review some of my excel knowledge while also providing a useful tool to caclulate my grades with. I would like to expand on the project eventually.

#### My Personal Coputer Information
- ![Computer Information](https://github.com/zbennett1/My-Portfolio/blob/main/CS105%20my%20computer%20info%20picture.png?raw=true)
- I came up with this project because I wanted to know what my computer information was and use my experience to inform me on future computer purchases I might want to make.
I used the list of computer information from an earlier project and did research through the dell website to find my information
Many of the categories of information wasnt explicitally stated so I had to either do more research deeper into the dell website or for things such as CPU speed I looked up the CPU itself to find the information
The only resources I used was the Dell website for most computer info and microsoft to find things such as screen resolution and CPU speed
I set out to find information on my computer and I think I achieved it. In the future I would like to look more in depth to what categories I think might need improvement when I buy my next computer. 
Overall this project was very informative. I didnt realize I had a TB of space which Is great to utilize for the amount of schoolwork I have but I think I might need more battery life on my next computer

#### Important goals for the future query
- ![Future Goals](https://github.com/zbennett1/My-Portfolio/blob/main/CS105%20query%20of%20the%20future%20picture.png?raw=true)
Initial project idea: 
I wanted to come up with a way to chart my future goals and sort them into categories and sort them into importance as I think it would help me keep track of what I need to be doing
I used microsoft access and their table and query tools. I used the query criteria option to select the goals that I ranked as the most important
Microsoft access is very buggy and crashed a couple of times which set back my work. I also struggled to rank the importance of each goal as they all seemed very important but I decided to do it on what I need to do right now compared to what could wait until the future.
I did not use any other resources for this project 
I set out to make a chart that could sort my goals based on importance and I did achieve that however in the future I would like to add more of my goals and possibly make a better ranking system for importance that is based on multiple different factors
Overall this project helped me review my future goals but I will note that microsoft access is a very hard thing to use especially with how old it is. I had many problems with it crashing or not doing my inputs.
